# pairsOfSquares
A game where a user must match pairs of digits to win. The premise is to click in squares with similar digits, without clicking in other squares in between.

When a square is clicked, the digit is revealed. Only one digit is revealed each time. The user must click to a square with the same digit as the open. When this happens, 
the pair is matched and remains open. The game ends when all the squares are revealed.

When a pair is clicked , +10 points are credited,when two consecutive pairs are clicked, +20 points are credited etc. When the user clicks at a square that does not match the 
open one,1 point is reduced.
